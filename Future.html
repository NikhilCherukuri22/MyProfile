                                       The position I want to peruse is Computer engineer, a Computer engineer's job is to analyse hardware, software and other parts of a computer system using technology and provided technical tools. The other responsibilities of a computer engineer is to upgrade different hardware like routers and motherboard as needed. This job can be a full time position or work under contract.
                                       <br>
                                       <br>

                                       This is appealing to me as I am a Tactile learner and I prefer to work hard on instead of an office setting. I’ve also always been interested in the hardware side of tech over the software though both still interest me.

                                For this job I need to be well versed in hardware side but also the software. The Qualifications that I need are a bachelor’s in IT and a master’s in computer engineering or 5 years of industry experience.
                                I would also need to work well in a team but on the contrary also be capable of working and solving issues on my own.

                        <p class="text-content">
I have some experience in creating websites and using python to create simple software, I am self motivated to learn and continually push myself to learn the fundamentals of coding and how it works, this interest I have in programming has enabled me to also articulate a pathway of how I plan to further learn more complicated concepts, by doing further studies apart from my university, using resources such as linkedIn learning and other open source programming courses.
<br>
<br>
This will not only help me get the job as a software engineer, but assist me in excelling in my role, as technology is ever changing and so should my knowledge and understanding of the different programming concepts.
