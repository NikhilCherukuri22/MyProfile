                                 These are my results from doing the Myers Briggs test. It says my type is INFP, basically saying that I am sensitive, caring, and am deeply concerned with my personal growth.
                                 It explained that I mostly rely on intuition and am more focused in the bigger picture, moreover it says that I am quite meticulous about things and projects I really care about.
                                 Lastly it says when it comes to decesion making I try to keep my options open to make the best one and think moslt with my head and not emotions.

                            This is the result of the learn style test; it shows that I am a tactile learner, which implies that I learn through feeling and doing. I'm not sure whether this is right; I'm skeptical of this result's reliability. This is due to the fact that I learn mostly via observation. For example, when I initially started working, I was able to complete complex duties without any official training. This is due to the vast amount of knowledge I gained simply by witnessing other employees do the same. Moving forwards if this outcome is truly true, rather than merely watching a video or reading an article and assuming that I have all the information I need to perform a specific action.

                               This test did not provide a graph or any photographical image, it was a personality test in order to advise me in which career path I should take, it said that my career path would be software engineering/IT due to my logical thinking.
