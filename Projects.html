                              <h2>YourSkin</h2>
                              <p class="text-content"> The majority of teenagers and adolescents struggle with knowledge on skin care and acne prevention measures. A common misconception is that acne is soley caused by teen and adolescent hormones, majority of teenagers may prevent/resolve this issue by correct skin care mesures unique to their skin type. It is rather important to individualise said routines to each individuals skin type.
  <br /><br />
Another common misconception is that said skin care routines are only useful for acne, this cannot be further from the truth due to the many benefits of beginning skin care routines at a young age. Said benefits include, better aging, wrinkle prevention, and prevention of skin/sun related cancer.
  <br /><br />
Too often the target demographic are seen spending large sums on products marketed by big brands with appealing item packaging and generic ingredients. While there is a large market of organic and healthy products that remain untouched due to the lack of knowledge by the masses. This results in a downward spiral of no results and wasted money. According to the National Library of Medicine a study by Br J Dermatol July 2015 “Acne is estimated to affect 9.4% of the global population, making it the eighth most prevalent disease worldwide.”
  <br /><br />
YourSkin is an application that will categorise your skin condition into 5 different categories with a simple sample photo of your face, providing an appropriate and effective skin care routine accompanied with a clean yet sophisticated user interface. Once placed in a categegory the user will receive a small variety of fitting skin care routines with the most relavant and effective on the top. The user will then be given the chance to choose one of the few routines based on their financial and time commitments. The different options will range from beginner to advanced, with the beginner needing the least time and financial commitments, and advanced needing the most.
  <br /><br />

The algorithm that diagnoses the user has been run through extensive machine learning containing multiple cases and categories of skin care problems thus enabling it to find a fitting diagnosis beneficial to the patient. As this algorithm will be able to diagnose a majority of users, there will be cases where said issues are unreasolvable with only over the counter products. In this case the user will be referred first referred to a local General Practitioner with the end goal of receiving a referral to a dermatologist/skin specialist.
  <br /><br />
YourSkin, using the API of google maps, will be able to direct the user to the closest and cheapest pharmacy that contains the products of the skin care routine chosen, the user will be able to sort pharmecys ranging from best prices to the highest rated and to the closest, depending on the priorities of the patient.
This application will take advantage of notifications by notifying the user of the times that they need to be completing their routine, when this notification pops up, and when the user clicks it, there will be a checklist that opens that will allow the user to check off the products they used in the order that is recommended. Proceeding completion of the checklist, there will be a streak that will continue as long as they complete the routines on time. The user will be motivated to keep this streak up, and will be rewarded with a discount on certain products after keeping the streak for two months.
  <br /><br />
The categories of skin care issues will include hyperpigmentation/sun-damage, oily/dry skin, blackheads/whiteheads, acne and tissue scarring.
  <br /><br />
There will also be a review page that contains reviews of patients of over two months, this will allow the user to navigate through and relate to said reviews increasing trust in the application and the skin care routines that it provides. The user may return to said reviews and even create their own proceeding two months of successful streak. Throughout the streak the user will optionally be able to provide progression photos that will in the end be applied to the review or simply for the users interest alone in order to track progress.
  <br /><br />
There will also be a referral system that will encourage the user to refer the application to friends and family, after five successful referrals in which a referred user creates an account and purchases a product, the user that referred will receive a large discount on the next skin care product they purchase.
  <br /><br />
There will be two major tools and technologies that will be used for the success of the application, at the beginning of the application when the user is asked to sign in, there will be an option to sign in with social media in order to network with friends and family making referral much easier. The API of google maps will be used in order to direct the user to required locations. TenserFlow will also be used in order to guide our AI into categorising the different skin issues.
  <br /><br />
In order to successfully create this application, we will need machine learning and data scientests to create the algorithm and maintain it in order to achieve the best diagnosis. Due to the target demographic being mainly teenagers and adolecsents, an exceptional user interface is absolutely vital to the success of this application, meaning frondtend developers must be hired. Project managers and scrum masters will also be hired in order to oversee the agile workflow of the creation of this application. Great backend and security engineers will also need to be hired in order to put the application together in a way that would maintain user privacy and security.
  <br /><br />
Results are not always guaranteed, but with that being said, the target demographic will begin to select the correct routines to their skin, seeing major results, not just in their skin but also in finance as these routines will already be optimised to the most cost effective products. The original problem of the target demographic not being able to maintain good skin condition by selecting appropriate products will be solved, in addition the users that have not yet seen a specialist when their condition is in need of one, will be made aware of this option that may have once been hidden from them.
