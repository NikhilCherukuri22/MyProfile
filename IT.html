                                       My interests in IT are software development and machine learning as it baffles me that these complex programs and websites are all just strings of text and symbols. My intent in It first started when I was younger as my uncle works for Microsoft as a software developer. I would watch and see how he worked and the end results him and hi team would make. This Peaked my interest so I started using a very basic coding software called scratch. At first I developed simple game such as pong and ETC. eventually I made a more advanced game that you require you as the driver to park in the spot chosen by a randomiser. It was very basic at the beginning but it sparked my passion for IT.

                              Previously I was studying in high school but decided to drop out as there was a carer path available through open UNI in which I did not need to finish my high school career. I also chose RMIT as it is the top university in Melbourne whin it comes to IT.
